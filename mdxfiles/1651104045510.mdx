The current webpage has been develop using the instructions on this blog.

This guide follows Harry Wolf's youtube tutorial video with some personal modifications we added.

Please watch and subscribe to his YouTube Channel:

[![IMAGE_ALT](https://img.youtube.com/vi/vu9gPcPs3mY/2.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu9gPcPs3mY)

You will find the code of this page on my public [repository](https://github.com/albac/dev-blogs)

Also I have opened a [pull request](https://github.com/hswolff/blog-with-nextjs-and-tailwind/pull/2) to the original author with the changes done on this blog.

<h2>Requirements</h2>
As you can tell by looking at my projects I use "vim" as a personal editor and use command line for most setups.

Feel free to use any editor, but if you follow this tutorial expect no other tools.

For this specific project we will use the following:

```
- Node v18.0.0
- NextJs v11.1.0
- React 17.0.2
- Tailwindcss 3.0.24
- nextjs-mdx-remote from harshicorp
- Other NPM packages: date-fns, gray-matter
```

<h2>The setup</h2>

Make sure you have the latest [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) installed:

```
$ node --version
v18.0.0
```

Let's create a new [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/docs) project:

```
$ npx create-next-app@latest dev-blogs
```

---

### Downgrading to React 17

At the moment of writing this blog, [React 18](https://reactjs.org/blog/2022/03/29/react-v18.html) was recently released and NextJs will install the latest React.

Nextjs-remote-mdx had [issues](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote/pull/267) with React 18..

So let's downgrade to React 17 before we continue.

```
$ cd dev-blogs
$ rm package-lock.json
$ vim package.json
```

And change the following:

```
From:
    "react": "18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "18.0.0",
To:
    "react": "17.0.2",
    "react-dom": "17.0.2",
```

Run npm install to downgrade to React:

```
$ npm install
```

---

### Installing and configuration for tailwindcss

Follow [tailwindcss](https://https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs) setup instructions for [NextJs](https://nextjs.org/docs).

```
$ https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/nextjs
$ npx tailwindcss init -p
```

Change the file styles/globals.css with the following content:

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

Optionally I added some base style to styles/globals.css for links and headings:

```
@layer base {
    a {
        @apply text-blue-600 hover:text-blue-500 dark:text-sky-400;
    }
    h1 {
        @apply dark:text-gray-300 text-3xl;
    }
    h2 {
        @apply text-2xl;
    }
    h3 {
        @apply text-xl;
    }
}
```

---

### Tailwindcss Typography setup

Tailwindcss [Typography plugin](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) will allow us to add more control to the styling of Markdown.

Run the following command to install the plugin:

```
$ npm install -D @tailwindcss/typography
```

Also add the plugin to the tailwindcss configuration file, tailwind.config.js to look like this:

```
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}",
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [require("@tailwindcss/typography")],
};

```

---

### Install nextjs-mdx-remote and other npm packages

Now install [nextjs-mdx-remote](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote) and all other npm package dependencies:

```
$ npm install gray-matter --save
$ npm install date-fns --save
$ npm install next-mdx-remote --save
```

---

### Build and Start NextJs

Usually you only need to run "yarn dev" to start and test the server.

However, for NextJs specially, I recommend to run "yarn build" often to verify everything is going well.

So run 'yarn build' and verify you get something similar to this:

```
$ yarn build
yarn run v1.22.18
warning ../../../package.json: No license field
$ next build
info  - Checking validity of types
info  - Creating an optimized production build
info  - Compiled successfully
info  - Collecting page data
info  - Generating static pages (7/7)
info  - Finalizing page optimization

●  (SSG)     automatically generated as static HTML + JSON (uses getStaticProps)

✨  Done in 7.99s.
```

This usually indicates that there are not issues at the moment to compile and generate the static content.

Now just run "yarn dev" to start the server and start coding.

```
$ yarn dev
yarn run v1.22.18
warning ../../../package.json: No license field
$ next dev
ready - started server on 0.0.0.0:3000, url: http://localhost:3000

<h2> The Code </h2>

We will not go over every detail instead we will focus on the changes and personal modifications we made.

If you like to go every detail of the code, please watch [Harry Wolf's YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vu9gPcPs3mY). He explains this on detail and very well.

### Patching [Optional]

Currently there is a [Pull Request](https://github.com/hswolff/blog-with-nextjs-and-tailwind/pull/2) waiting for merge.

If this is merged by the time this post is publish, this will be obsolete.

We recommend to start from a new project and add the changes describe on the YouTube video.

However, we are providing steps to use the [original author github](https://github.com/hswolff/blog-with-nextjs-and-tailwind).

First, clone original author git repo:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/hswolff/blog-with-nextjs-and-tailwind.git
```

Second, go to blog-with-nextjs-and-tailwind.git, and make sure package.json, has the following changes:

```
git diff -- package.json
diff --git a/package.json b/package.json
index c99a4c7..847d589 100644
--- a/package.json
+++ b/package.json
@@ -8,15 +8,15 @@

   },
   "dependencies": {
-    "@tailwindcss/typography": "^0.4.0",
+    "@tailwindcss/typography": "^0.5.2",
     "autoprefixer": "^10.2.4",
     "date-fns": "^2.17.0",
     "gray-matter": "^4.0.2",
-    "next": "10.0.6",
-    "next-mdx-remote": "^2.1.3",
+    "next": "12.1.5",
+    "next-mdx-remote": "^4.0.2",
     "postcss": "^8.2.6",
-    "react": "17.0.1",
-    "react-dom": "17.0.1",
-    "tailwindcss": "^2.0.3"
+    "react": "17.0.2",
+    "react-dom": "17.0.2",
+    "tailwindcss": "^3.0.24"
   }
 }
```

This is needed because we are working with latest Node and upgrades are needed for this blog.

Remove yarn.lock file and run npm instal.

```
$ rm -f yarn.lock
$ npm install
```

At this point, you should be able to run "yarn dev".

```
$ yarn dev
```

However there are some modifications and upgrades on the code that we will take on the next section.

### Changes for next-mdx-remote

Here we will explain the changes we added to improve or fix current issues due to some packages upgrades.

[Breaking release](https://github.com/hashicorp/next-mdx-remote/releases/tag/3.0.0) Next-mdx-remote V3 included internal rewrites from V2

This blog is using next-mdx-remote 4.0.2.

So we need to change the following file [pages/blog/[slug].js](https://github.com/albac/dev-blogs/blob/main/pages/blog/%5Bslug%5D.js).

```
-import renderToString from 'next-mdx-remote/render-to-string';
-import hydrate from 'next-mdx-remote/hydrate';
+import { serialize } from 'next-mdx-remote/serialize';
+import { MDXRemote } from 'next-mdx-remote';
```

Hydrate function is not longer necessary instead you can use MDXRemote directly to hydrate the markdown content:

```
<MDXRemote {...content} />
```

renderToString has been replaced with serialize:

```
-  const mdxSource = await renderToString(content);
+  const mdxSource = await serialize(content);
```

---

### Generate date and create mdx file:

On Harry video tutoria he uses node command line to generate the date that will use on the mdx content file.

We are using a similar command line but we want to create the file with a name we can sort by date on the home page.

```
$ node -e 'console.log(new Date().toISOString(), new Date().getTime())'
2022-04-27T23:34:37.161Z 1651102477161
```

With this we can create the file with the name from the getTime output and the date on the content from toISOString output.

```
$ vim mdxfiles/1651102477161.mdx

  Short description

Some content here....

```

Now let's modify the [index.js](https://github.com/albac/dev-blogs/blob/main/pages/index.js#L35) file and reverse array order, so we get the latest blog on top.

Use slice(0).reverse.map to reverse the array:

```
posts: allPosts
    .slice(0)
    .reverse()
    .map(({ data, slug }) => ({
        ...data,
        date: data.date.toISOString(),
        content: data.summary,
        slug,
    })),

```

---

### Use typography plugin and prose

Tailwindcss provides typography plugin to give more control and styling to markdown.

We use the instructions from the [tailwindcss/typography](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/typography-plugin) documentation.

```
<article className="prose dark:prose-invert text-slate-600 dark:text-slate-300 font-light font-sans">
    <MDXRemote {...content} />
</article>

```

We use prose class and we can use html tags on the markdown.

```
<h2>The setup</h2>

Make sure you have the latest [node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/current/) installed:

```

We also using dark:prose-inverse, which allows to use our dark theme on the Markdown.

The end result can be seen in this page style.

Compare this page site to site with the [GitHub Link](https://github.com/albac/dev-blogs/blob/main/mdxfiles/1651104045510.mdx) to see the difference.
